When disasters strike, effective risk financing - for example, insurance - can help communities and economies to recover quicker and with reduced enduring impacts. In my research, I am interested in a new wave of insurance - “index insurance” - which gained popularity through its claimed potential to address the shortcomings of traditional insurance, which has to date failed in emerging economies around the world. Specifically, I seek to understand whether new datasets - in particular, remote sensing - can support scalable index insurance mechanisms in emerging economies, and to quantify the extent to which index design choices influence outcomes for an eventual policy holder.

My motivation for this stems from my time working in the global reinsurance industry, where I worked with public sector clients - including the Moroccan government - to develop macro (re)insurance programs intended to build resilience through novel approaches to risk finance. I aim to contribute towards more focused research into different index metrics and approaches to encourage rigorous, transparent and validated index designs being implemented in emerging real-world index insurance programs.

Ultimately, new financing schemes must meet the needs of the vulnerable people whom they promise to serve, and so responsibility and accountability in program design is critical as governments, groups and individuals consider new approaches to risk financing as part of their broader risk management strategies.
